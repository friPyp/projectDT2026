## 0. Session log (append one entry per pass — never delete old entries)

### Pass 1 (in progress, checkpoint push) — 2026-09-09 — frPyP — Session 1 scaffold, partially verified
Branch/commit: main (direct push, checkpoint mid-session — more coming same session)
Did:
- Set up pnpm-workspace monorepo (`apps/backend`, `apps/frontend`)
- Wrote full Prisma schema (`apps/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`) covering
  users, partners, challenges, notifications per REFERENCE §6
- Wrote seed script (`apps/backend/prisma/seed.ts`): 1 citizen, 1 admin,
  4 partners (one per domain cluster)
- Wrote minimal backend boot code (`src/index.ts`, `src/prisma.ts`) —
  intentionally just an Express server + `/api/v1/health` DB-ping route,
  no real API routes yet (those are session 2+, staying in scope)
- Scaffolded frontend with Vite React-TS template, then added Tailwind
  (v4, via @tailwindcss/vite), React Router, React Hook Form, Zod, and
  TanStack Query per REFERENCE §4. Wired up a minimal `main.tsx`/`App.tsx`
  that boots Router + QueryClientProvider + Tailwind together — placeholder
  only, no real pages (session 3's job)
Files touched: see commit diff — all new files, nothing pre-existing touched
Decisions made:
- Resolved a conflict in PROJECT_REFERENCE.md itself: §6 schema had no
  `district` field on `users`, but §8's `/auth/register` contract expects
  one. Flagged to frPyP, decided: **add `district` (nullable String) to the
  User model** — nullable because partner/admin seed accounts don't have one.
  This should be reflected in PROJECT_REFERENCE.md §6 by whoever edits it
  next (not done yet — flagging here per the "append a note" rule in
  REFERENCE §9).
- Backend deps beyond what REFERENCE §4 names explicitly: added `cors`,
  `dotenv`, `bcryptjs` (not `bcrypt`, to avoid native-compile issues),
  `jsonwebtoken` — all standard, small supporting libraries required to
  actually implement the already-approved stack (Express + JWT + Prisma),
  not architectural changes. Flagged to frPyP in-chat, not objected to.
- Used pnpm 9 (not the newest pnpm major) because pnpm 10+'s new
  build-script-approval gate couldn't be satisfied non-interactively in the
  dev sandbox used for this session. Pure tooling choice, doesn't affect the
  actual stack.
Deviations from spec: none beyond the district fix above.
Bugs found/fixed: n/a yet — no runtime testing possible for DB-touching code
  (see below).
Left in a broken/incomplete state:
- **Migration confirmed applied against the real Neon database** (frPyP ran
  it via Termux + proot-distro Ubuntu, since Prisma's engine can't run
  directly on Termux's Android environment or in the dev sandbox used
  earlier in this session — both needed a real Linux environment).
  Prisma's own output confirmed: "Your database is now in sync with your
  schema." This is a genuine, verified result — not sandbox-only.
- **Seed script failed on that same run** — not a data/logic bug, a missing
  config: `apps/backend/package.json` didn't have the `"prisma": { "seed":
  ... }` block Prisma's CLI needs to know how to invoke `prisma/seed.ts`.
  **Fixed** in this pass (added `"prisma": { "seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts" }`
  to `apps/backend/package.json`). Not yet re-run/confirmed after the fix —
  that's the very next thing to do.
- `apps/backend/src/prisma.ts` was earlier type-checked in the dev sandbox
  against a generic Prisma client stub, not real generated types. Now that
  `prisma generate` has actually run successfully against the real schema
  (confirmed by the migration run above), this concern is resolved — real
  types exist now.
- Frontend `pnpm build` and `pnpm dev` (HTTP 200, root page served) were
  both verified working with Tailwind + Router + TanStack Query wired in —
  this part of Session 1 is genuinely done.
Anything the next person picking this up needs to know:
- Migration is done and confirmed against the real Neon database. The only
  remaining step is: `cd apps/backend`, `npx prisma db seed` (now that the
  config fix is in place), then confirm `GET /api/v1/health` returns
  `{ success: true, db: "connected" }`. This needs a real Linux environment
  (a normal machine, or Termux + proot-distro Ubuntu on Android) — plain
  Termux alone fails with an "unknown OS android" error from Prisma, and
  the dev sandbox used earlier in this session can't reach Prisma's engine
  download host at all.

---

## 1. Current phase

**Session 1 nearly done.** Scaffold, schema, and frontend are all done and
verified. The migration has been confirmed applied against the real Neon
database. The only remaining step is running the seed script (it failed
once on a missing config, now fixed, not yet re-confirmed) and one final
health-check confirmation.

## 1a. Who owns what (fill in once assigned)

| Area | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Citizen (auth + submission + dashboard) | _unassigned_ | not started |
| Partner + Routing (categorization, routing, partner dashboard, notifications) | _unassigned_ | not started |
| Dashboard + Admin | _unassigned_ | not started |

Stick to your lane unless you've pulled latest and checked this file — two
people editing the same module in the same day is how things get lost.

---

## 2. Repo state

- Repo initialized: **Yes**
- Remote: `github.com/friPyp/projectDT2026`
- Package manager: **pnpm** (v9.x — v10+ has a build-approval gate that
  didn't play well with the dev sandbox used for this session; either
  version is fine on a normal machine, this is not a hard requirement)
- Branch strategy: `main` = always working/demoable. Feature branches per
  person per task, e.g. `feat/citizen-submission`. PR into `main` when a pass
  is done and this file is updated. (Team is 2 non-technical + 1 technical —
  direct push to `main` with pull-first discipline is fine if PRs prove to be
  too much overhead.)

---

## 3. What's built (exhaustive, not summarized)

### Backend
- Endpoints implemented: `GET /api/v1/health` only (DB-ping check, not a
  real feature endpoint)
- Middleware implemented: `cors`, `express.json()` only
- Modules scaffolded: `src/index.ts`, `src/prisma.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`,
  `prisma/seed.ts`

### Database
- Prisma schema written: **Yes** (`apps/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Tables migrated: **Yes — confirmed applied to the real Neon database**
  (migration `20260909050527_init`, run via Termux + proot-distro Ubuntu)
- Seed data present: **Not yet confirmed** — failed once on a missing
  `package.json` config (now fixed), re-run pending

### Frontend
- Pages implemented: _none_ — single placeholder page proving boot only
- Shared components: _none_
- Tailwind / React Router / React Hook Form / Zod / TanStack Query:
  **Yes, all installed and wired up** (Tailwind v4 via @tailwindcss/vite,
  Router + QueryClientProvider active in main.tsx). `pnpm build` and
  `pnpm dev` both verified working.
- API client / TanStack Query hooks set up: **No** (provider wired, no
  actual queries/hooks yet — that's session 3+)

### Auth
- JWT issuing/verifying: **No** (session 2)
- Roles enforced: **No** (session 2)
- Demo accounts seeded: **No** (script written, not run — see above)

### Categorization + routing
- Keyword-match categorization function: **No** (session 4, not started —
  correctly not built ahead of phase)
- Auto-routing to seeded partners: **No** (session 4)

### Notifications
- Implemented: **No** (session 6)

---

## 4. In progress right now

frPyP, same session: migration confirmed against real Neon DB. Re-running
seed now that the missing config is fixed, then one final health-check
confirmation to fully close Session 1.

---

## 5. Known bugs

- Fixed: seed script couldn't run because `apps/backend/package.json` was
  missing the `"prisma": { "seed": ... }` config block. Added in this pass.
- No longer an issue: earlier concern about Prisma's engine binary being
  unreachable only applied to the dev sandbox used for the initial scaffold
  — running on Termux (via proot-distro Ubuntu, since plain Termux itself
  isn't a real enough Linux environment for Prisma either) worked fine and
  the migration is confirmed applied.

---

## 6. Next task (specific enough that anyone — teammate or fresh chat — can pick it up cold)

Finish Session 1 (last two steps):
1. Re-run `npx prisma db seed` (from `apps/backend`) — should work now that
   the missing `package.json` config is fixed
2. Confirm backend boots and `GET /api/v1/health` returns
   `{ success: true, db: "connected" }`
3. Once seed output shows the demo accounts were created and the health
   check passes, Session 1 is fully done and Session 2 (auth) can start

Migration is already confirmed working — nothing left to do there. Frontend
scaffold is already done and boot-verified — nothing left to do there either.

---

## 7. Key decisions / deviations from original spec (cumulative — never delete)

- Auto-routing on submission instead of a manual admin review/validation
  step — admin is a dashboard viewer for MVP, not a workflow participant.
- No "claim" step for partners — if routed to them, it's immediately theirs.
- No milestones table — single status field on the challenge only.
- Team is a plain text field, not a real team/member entity.
- Partners are seeded demo orgs, not self-registering. Only citizens register
  through the UI.
- No real-time/polling anywhere in this project — plain fetch-on-load is
  sufficient, nothing here needs a "watch it update live" moment.
- Categorization is a keyword-match function, not a real ML model or external
  API call — still satisfies "AI-enabled classification" for demo purposes.
- **API contract is frozen once written — changing an endpoint shape after
  another teammate has built against it requires posting in the group chat
  first, not just editing the file silently.**
- **Added `district` (nullable) to the User model** to resolve a conflict
  between PROJECT_REFERENCE.md §6 (schema) and §8 (API contract) — see Pass 1
  log. PROJECT_REFERENCE.md §6 itself still needs a corresponding update by
  whoever's next in that file (per REFERENCE §9's change-log rule).

## 8. Environment variables needed so far

```
DATABASE_URL=      # Neon Postgres connection string (see frPyP for it; kept out of git)
JWT_SECRET=        # any random string for local dev
PORT=4000
```

---

## 9. API surface implemented so far

See `PROJECT_REFERENCE.md` §8 for the frozen contract. This section tracks
what's **actually implemented** vs. contracted (may lag behind the contract
early on).

```
GET /api/v1/health   -> { success: true, db: "connected" }   (not part of the
                          frozen contract — internal boot-check only)
```

---

## 10. Demo accounts

```
CITIZEN: citizen@demo.local / Demo@1234
ADMIN:   admin@demo.local / Demo@1234
PARTNER (x4, seeded, one per domain cluster): partner1@demo.local ... partner4@demo.local / Demo@1234
```

Note: these accounts exist in the seed script but have **not yet been
created in the real database** — see §3 and §6 above.
